# Mushroom Farm AI â€” Project Idea

This project shows how to apply RAG + Agents to your mushroom-growing business:
- Ingest SOPs, manuals, and lab notes
- Build an agent that answers "how to adjust humidity" or "troubleshoot contamination"
- Connect to sensors (optional) via webhook and create alerts with n8n

Mini-challenges:
- Ingest 5 documents about mushroom care and ask troubleshooting questions.
- Build a daily digest email of potential issues using n8n + your agent API.
